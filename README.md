   This database includes period groups, age groups, cohort groups, male diabetes death counts, male mid-period population, and the crude male diabetes mortality rate per 100,000 population. It 
   also includes the age group, period, and cohort categories required for some graphs.

   This database includes the count of deaths attributed to diabetes mellitus for males in Lexis table format according to age groups (rows), period groups (columns) and birth 
   cohort groups (diagonals).
